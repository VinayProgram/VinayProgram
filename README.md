# 👋 Hey there, I'm Vinay Tandale!

> *“Not just a programmer — an innovator, a dreamer, a connector of ideas.”*

Welcome to my digital playground! Here’s where my experiments, unfinished sketches, wild ideas, and bold ambitions come together.

## 🧩 About Me

- 💻 **Self-taught Dev & 3D Explorer** — From hacking together hand-tracking with TensorFlow.js & Three.js to crafting dynamic modules in Next.js, I love bending code to do what *I* imagine, not just what the docs say.
- 🧠 **Math Learner** — Building my own AI needs more than code — it needs math, and I’m on that journey. Vectors, dot products, matrix transformations, you name it — I’m mastering it, one messy notebook at a time.
- 🤖 **AI Believer** — I see a future where AI empowers humans to deeply understand themselves and their world. I’m experimenting with everything from KNN classifiers to generative AI for stroke-based drawing.
- 🌱 **Curious, Always** — I believe that houses with open doors and windows let positive energy flow in and out. My mind works the same way — open to learning, exploring, and letting old ideas go when they no longer serve.

## 🛠️ Tech I Play With

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, C++ (just for fun)
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, React, R3F, NestJS
- **3D & Graphics:** Three.js, WebGL, shader experiments
- **AI & ML:** TensorFlow.js, scikit-learn, custom models
- **Tools:** Docker, AWS, custom modules
- **Favorite Toy:** Breaking things until they work better.

## 🗂️ What You'll Find Here

- ✨ Old projects I still open sometimes because they feel *alive*.
- 🧬 Experimental repos — hand-tracking, graph plotting, real-time data visualization.
- 📊 Graphs, math experiments, code for personal AI tools.
- 🌐 Little steps toward big dreams —  my own OS someday, or even a matchmaking system based on real browser and YouTube history.

## 📌 Aspirations

- 🔭 mathematics for ML & build my *own* AI — not just another model, but an *understanding*.
- 🌏 Connect tech with real impact — for healthcare, for people’s daily lives.
- 💡 Create systems bigger than just apps — kernels, frameworks, maybe my own OS.
- 🧘 Balance passion with calm — some days doors open for new things, some days they close to finish what I’ve started.
